Chandrayaan-3 is the third lunar exploration mission by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).[7] It consists of a lander and the Pragyan rover similar to Chandrayaan-2, but does not have an orbiter. Its propulsion module behaves like a communication relay satellite. The propulsion module carries the lander and rover configuration until the spacecraft is in a 100 km lunar orbit.
